    "The headlines are scraped using Selenium from the Investing.com website. The headlines are then preprocessed and their sentiment analyzed using the lexicon approach described by Loughran and McDonald [1]. The lexicon approach entails the use of two lists of words, one negative and one positive, counting the number of each type of word as well as the frequency of each individual word. This method yields a score for each headline, which is then aggregated on a daily basis to determine the score of the day.\n",
